hi so for the order.js, can we use a more basic ordering mechanic right now, then next week we can use the advanced ordering system
so we have more time, cuz the advanced ordering system right now has a lot of stuff that we don't have the assets for and 
we only have like 1 and a half more days to do stuff.

I made a lot more basic version of order.js in the file worse_but_simpler_lemonade folder
